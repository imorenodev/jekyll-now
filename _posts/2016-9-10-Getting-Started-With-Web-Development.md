title: Getting Started With Web Development
---

I've been dabbling with HTML and Javascript, Ruby on Rails, Python, and even C# for years, aimlessly wandering from technology stack to technology stack and never mastering anything. The biggest problem for me is that I've listened to so many opinions, always worried about what the *next best language or framework* is going to be and what I should focus on to be the most marketable to emplyers.

It wasn't until I went to a Ruby on Rails bootcamp that I realized just how much I didn't know about web development. There are so many rabbit holes to fall down and trying to learn everything there is to learn will take literally forever because the field is moving so fast and is constantly changing.

The biggest lesson that I've taken away these past few years is that the only constant in Web Development is change, and that the most valuable skill is the ability to learn fast and self-teach any technology that you need to learn to get the job done.

I've settled the bulk of my learning efforts on Javascript, specifically  the ReactJS, Express, and MongoDB stack. As Javascript becomes more and more ubiquitous, this seems like the most reasonable language to master and build projects with while I'm in school. 

I have two main goals during my Computer Science education:

1) Network and make long-lasting professional relationships among fellow students and instructors.

2) Get good at practical Javascript development, and get REALLY good at Java object-oriented and functional programming principles, learn the theory, data structures, and algorithms necessary to be able to call myself a software engineer.

I hope to update this blog frequently with technical articles and personal thoughts about my journey to earn my Computer Science degree.

Until next time!
